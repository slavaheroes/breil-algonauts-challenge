# Brain Diffuser & Versatile Diffusion

### Approach 1

The idea comes from [Brain Diffuser paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05334).
However, before using Diffusion, I'd like to extract features of images using VDVAE following the [tutorial](https://github.com/ozcelikfu/brain-diffuser/tree/main).

This folder corresponds to the first stage of the algorithm shown in the paper above.
